# Kotlin for Java Developers

A project I created to demonstrate how to integrate Kotlin into Enterprise  Java codebases. It is intended to go along with a series of notes I created to teach this subject to colleagues.

The project contains a number of branches which correspond to the state of the code at the end of different Sections of the notes.
